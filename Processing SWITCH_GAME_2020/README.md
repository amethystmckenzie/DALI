# SWITCH GAME - PROCESSING
## Amethyst McKenzie

This was the original Switch Game that I made using Processing before I adapted it to Unity and IOS.

Instructions:
 - you're at the home page!
   - click controls to see the controls or click options to see the options page!
   - if you're on the options page, click any circle to change your ball colour
   - for both controls and option pages, press 'B' to begin or press '0' to go back to menu
   - press 'c' to show the credits page (can only access this on home, controls, or options screen -- the menu)
 - home page: press 'B' to start playing. 
   - once in the game, press your right arrow to move forward or press your left arrow to move backward.
   - switch gravity by pressing the space bar
   - avoid red objects! (they are enemies)
   - if you hit an enemy you will die (have to restart the level you are on)
   - if you die more than 50 times (there is a counter!) you will have to restart from the beginning, no matter which level you're on
   - your goal is to reach the cyan square--the trophy! once you reach the trophy in all 3 levels you win!
 - enjoy playing++
